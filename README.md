This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in VHDL code: an incomplete conditional statement within a counter process.  The provided `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vhdl` shows the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail in VHDL, particularly when dealing with state machines and counters.
